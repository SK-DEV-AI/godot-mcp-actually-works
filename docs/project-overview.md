# Godot MCP Node Control - Project Overview

## What is This Project?

**Godot MCP Node Control** is a modern Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with complete control over Godot Engine scenes and nodes. This project bridges the gap between natural language AI interactions and the Godot game engine, enabling developers to build, modify, and debug Godot scenes through conversational commands.

## Core Mission

To create the most comprehensive and reliable MCP server for Godot Engine, providing AI assistants with enterprise-grade tools for game development workflows. This project aims to revolutionize how developers interact with Godot by making scene manipulation as natural as describing what you want to build.

## Key Features

- **Full scene hierarchy management** with create, move, delete, and organize operations
- **Property manipulation** for any Godot node property with type validation
- **Transform controls** for position, rotation, and scale in both 2D and 3D
- **Signal connections** for event-driven programming
- **Script attachment** with GDScript validation and error handling

### 🤖 AI-First Design
- **Context engineering** optimized for LLM tool usage
- **Rich tool descriptions** with examples and use cases
- **Progressive disclosure** of capabilities
- **Ground truth anchoring** with real Godot error messages
- **Robust reliability** with comprehensive error handling

   - Handles WebSocket communication with Godot addon

2. **Godot Addon** (`godot-addon/`)
   - Editor plugin that runs inside Godot
   - WebSocket server for receiving commands
   - Executes node operations with full undo support
   - Provides real-time error reporting

3. **Communication Layer**
   - JSON-RPC over WebSocket for reliable messaging
   - Asynchronous command processing
   - Connection health monitoring and auto-reconnection

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+ with FastMCP
- **Frontend**: Godot 4.5 with GDScript
- **Communication**: WebSocket with JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) 2025-06-18 specification
- **Dependencies**: websockets, fastmcp

## Use Cases

### Game Development Workflows
